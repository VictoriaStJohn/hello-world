# hello-world
This repository is practicing for the Github flow. 
I currently 20 years old, from Maryland. I live in Eden Prarie, MN with my fiance Sterling we have been together for 4 years now. We met in our algebra class in high school and hit it off cracking jokes and watching movies. I work as a scribe in an emergency room, and strive to go to medical school to become a psychiatrist. A few of my special interests are dinosaurs, ducks, and crabs.
